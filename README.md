# user journeys

as a rust beginner
I would like my builds to be fast
so that I get a good first impression of rust

as an open source contributor (starting on a new project)
i want to have pre-built packages
so that it takes less time to build a new project

as a user or github actions
I want to use a global cache of pre-built packages
so that my builds don't take 10 minutes 
(this can be solved with decent cache)



# cargo-quickbuild sketch design

## minimal version of the client:

- assume Cargo.lock is up to date
- explode immediately if it's not a debug build, or there are already release assets, or there is a .cargo/config that we should be honouring
- parse dependency tree using https://crates.io/crates/cargo-lock or similar
- for each root of the tree, serialise and compute a hash
  - fetch /cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE-rustc_version-arch from github releases of `cargo-quickbuild-releases` repo, and unpack
  - stretch goal: keep a download cache and/or unpack in a common place and hardlink them into target/
- if any cache miss happens, POST the full Cargo.lock somewhere.

## minimal version of the analyser:

- hoover up Cargo.lock files from rust-repos
- for each Cargo.lock file:
  - parse dependency tree
  - for each root:
    - caclulate cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE-rustc_version-arch
    - estimate the size of the dependency tree (unit = crate count?)
    - stats.count("cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE-rustc_version-arch", 1)
    - stats.count("cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE-rustc_version-arch-size", size)
    - store the serialised dependency tree in a `cargo-quickbuild-trees` git repo if it doesn't already exist

## minimal version of the service:

- receive Cargo.lock and store somewhere
- parse dependency tree
- for each root:
  - calculate the hash etc
  - store the
  - if the count for that hash exceeds $THRESHOLD and a build isn't started, trigger a build

## minimal version of the builder:

- When trigger comes in to build a package:
- fetch cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE serialised tree from the `cargo-quickbuild-trees` git repo
- unpack it into `Cargo.lock` and create a fake src/main.rs like how `cargo-chef` does
- create a fake Cargo.toml as well
- `cargo build --package=cratename`
- make a tarball of target/
- release it as `cratename-HASH_OF_DEPENDENCY_TREE-rustc_version-arch` on `cargo-quickbuild-releases` repo (should be fine to have a single commit in that repo and tag it will infinity git tags).


# pivot triggers

Analyser is part of validation stage. If we find lots of large common subtrees then we can continue with the project. If not then ‚èé or üöÆ .
* If 30% of all projects depending on tokio could fetch tokio's dependency tree from the same bundle then we're winning.
* Similar with tide/actix ?
* Do we discriminate for/against projects that are using dependabot to keep their dependencies in.
* Do we ignore inactive projects somehow?


# Possible pivots

There might be some value in saying "I see you're using $X. Would you like to buy $Y?"

# KPIs (Quantifiable things for later)

Time saved - can't know this yet because we can't build the whole world yet.
